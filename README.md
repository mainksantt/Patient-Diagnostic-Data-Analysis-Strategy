## 🩺 Project 1: Patient Diagnostic Data Analysis – Kidney Health (for Pfizer)

### 🔍 Problem Statement:
Pfizer needed to identify region-wise kidney health risk patterns using ACR (Albumin-Creatinine Ratio) data from 200 patients across 5 major Indian cities. The goal was to:
- Pinpoint high-risk cities and demographic clusters
- Recommend targeted medical interventions
- Identify doctors and cities for partnership expansion

### ✅ Solution Implemented:
- Performed EDA on patient ACR data segmented by age, gender, and city
- Categorized patients into Normal, Microalbuminuria, and Macroalbuminuria
- Identified critical hotspots: **Hyderabad (65% Macro)**, **Delhi (56%)**, with gender-age risk trends
- Recommended targeted campaigns, repeat testing protocols, and strategic partnerships
- Proposed Mumbai’s early detection model (11% Normal cases) as scalable best practice

📈 **Tools Used**: Excel, Python  
📊 **Impact**: Actionable insights for ₹500K+ in potential savings and intervention roadmap

## 🔬 Project 2: Instant Kidney Test Kit – GTM Strategy & CX Innovation

### 🔍 Problem Statement:
Post diagnosis, there was no scalable follow-up system for early-stage kidney patients. A need emerged for a **low-cost instant testing kit** supported by a **seamless customer experience** across urban clusters.

### ✅ Solution Implemented:
- Designed a **Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy** for an IoT-enabled ACR testing kit tailored to urban tier-1 populations
- Integrated **behavioral nudges** (SMS reminders, home sample pick-ups) to improve test completion rates
- Developed **CX-led journey map**: from symptom recognition to testing and post-report consultation
- Proposed collaborations with nephrologists + micro-lab aggregators for fulfillment

💡 **Customer Experience (CX) Enhancements**:
- Real-time results via WhatsApp
- Educational content using behavioral science (loss aversion, social proof)
- 3-click booking & feedback loop

📈 **Tools Used**: Journey Mapping, Behavioral Economics, CX Design  
📊 **Impact**: Projected 30% improvement in early detection and 2X test completion vs traditional clinics

## 📊 Project 3: Management Trainee Case Simulation – Profitability Optimization

### 🔍 Problem Statement:
A real-world simulation of category management required boosting profitability under resource and operational constraints.

### ✅ Solution Implemented:
- Built a dynamic Excel model tracking costs, GMV, margins, and retention
- Launched a **dual-lever strategy**:
  - Customer subscription model (16% → 35% repeat rate)
  - Supply-side cost reduction via part-time partner model
- Used KPI dashboards to simulate 6-month rollout

📈 **Tools Used**: Microsoft Excel, Strategic Forecasting, Unit Economics  
🚀 **Impact**: ₹143L ROI forecast with improved partner activation and reduced CAC
